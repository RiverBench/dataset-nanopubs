# Dataset: nanopubs (development version)

Nanopublications are small units of publishable information, used for scientific results and more. This dataset is based on a subset of [a dump of all available nanopublications](https://zenodo.org/record/1213293) as of April 5, 2018. Only the first 5M of freely-licensed nanopubs were included. Each nanopub consists of several RDF graphs and thus is an RDF dataset. The included data is primarily from the biomedical domain. More information: [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06532), [website](https://nanopub.net/).

*This README is a snapshot of documentation for the latest development version of the dataset.
Full documentation for all versions can be found [on the website](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/nanopubs/dev).*

Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.  Note that 'stream type usage' is a subjective assertion and instances of this class may be annotated with additional provenance properties to explain who made the assertion. There can be multiple views on what type of stream is in use, depending on the involved actor, processing step, etc.">RDF stream type usage</abbr> ([stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage](https://w3id.org/stax/ontology#RdfStreamTypeUsage))
